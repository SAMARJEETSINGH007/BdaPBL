Project to find the routes, filter them and find the status of the trains....
In here I have collected the reviews online and filtered them into advantages and disadvantages manually into excel files.
I have used the code for train, bus, flight link generation (leads to make my trip website)
You just have to choose from the given options
Filtering is done manually. The code for automated filtering is there in the concerned named files
That is for instance all the link generation code for train is there in TrainCodeGeneration.R
I have used the rapid indian rail api and the free version on it to get 50 searches per day. 
Code filters the data only for the Jammu to other stations. You can add new .csv files or excel files to get the same results.
